-   design slides with incrementally outputs
-   Printing to PDF

...and much more

## Preview Links {transition="slide"}

Navigate to hyperlinks without disrupting the flow of your presentation.

Use the `preview-links` option to open links in an iframe on top of your slides. Try clicking the link below for a demonstration:

[Quarto Homepage](https://quarto.org){preview-link="true" style="text-align: center"}

## Slide Visibility {.smaller transition="slide"}

#### Hide Slides

You can hide a slide by adding the visibility="hidden" attribute to the slide heading. For example:

    ## Slide Title {visibility="hidden"}

#### Uncounted Slides

Optional slides can sometimes be helpful that you may or may not have time to show.

To "hide" slides from then numbering system you can use `visibility="uncounted"`. For example:

    ## Slide 1

    ## Slide 2

    ## Slide 3 {visibility="uncounted"}
